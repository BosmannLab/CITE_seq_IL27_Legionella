# CITE_seq_IL27_Legionella
# This repository contains the codes used for analysis of CITE-seq data (single cell RNA + surface protein antibody derived tag [ADT]) sequencing experiment by Dr. Johannes Platten and Dr. Sarah Walachowski. <br>
- The experiment involved BALF from three wild type (WT; samples BM_WS_5, BM_WS_6, BM_WS_8) and three IL27RA knockout mice (IL27RAko; samples BM_WS_9, BM_WS_10, BM_WS_15). <br>
- Mice were infected for 48h with JR32 strain of Legionella pneumophila and then BALF cells were collected by Johannes and, frozen and shipped for further staining, FACSorting and sequencing by Sarah. Sequencing was performed at the Boston University Single Cell Sequencing Core. <br>
- Neutrophils were sorted out before Totalseq antibodies staining, so no neutrophil clusters are expected in the analysis. <br>
- The sequencing experiment included two libraries per sample: 1 ADT and 1 GEX. <br>
- A total of 198 custom BioLegend TotalSeq A ADTs were used. <br>
